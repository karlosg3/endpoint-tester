# ARO Endpoint Tester

A lightweight, browser-based API client (inspired by Postman) for testing RESTful endpoints. Built with speed and simplicity in mind using **Vite** and **pnpm**.

## 🛠️ Current Status: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

This project is currently in active development. The goal is to provide a clean interface for testing common HTTP methods and inspecting real-time responses.

### ✅ Supported Features

* **Request Methods:**
* `GET`: Fetch data from any public or local API.
* `POST`: Send new data to a server.
* `PATCH`: Test partial resource updates.
* `DELETE`: Verify resource removal.


* **Response Viewer:** Real-time display of the JSON response returned by the server.
* **Custom Headers:** (Planned/In-Progress) Ability to add Auth tokens or Content-Type headers.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture to keep components reusable:

* `/src/views`: Contains the main Tester dashboard.
* `/src/components/layout`: Houses the `Header`, `Navbar`, and `Footer`.
* `/src/components/common`: Contains the `RequestForm`, `MethodSelector`, and `ResponseDisplay`.
